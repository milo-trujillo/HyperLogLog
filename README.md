## HyperLogLog and Friends

This is the code from [my blog post on HyperHyperLog](https://backdrifting.net/post/066_hyperloglog).

This codebase includes implementations of [HyperLogLog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog), a probabilistic counting algorithm, and a multi-hash averaged probabilistic counting algorithm. It also contains some test code that runs each algorithm over a range of inputs and plots the results to illustrate differences in accuracy.
